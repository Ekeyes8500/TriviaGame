# Introduction
Welcome to the Trivial Endeavor! This is a simple JQuery web application that asks you themed questions and decides if you're fit to join Robert Falcon Scott on his notable expedition to the arctic!

The game operates by storing questions, their respones, and a value representing the correct answer in an array, using a "for" loop to spit its contents into the correct location and identify if the user's answer is correct
